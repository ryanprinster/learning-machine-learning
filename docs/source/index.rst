This is ML Sparknotes
===================================

This is my personal notes on machine learning, made public. What that means:

- This is meant to have the most important concepts, explainations, etc by my standards - NOT to teach ML from the ground up. 
- I read other sources to learn, so this might include snippets from other places. I'll attempt to record where I am referencing, but may not be perfect.
- There may be mistakes. If so, please feel free to correct them. 



Template Code:
===================================


**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
